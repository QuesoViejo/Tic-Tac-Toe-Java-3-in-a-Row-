# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java-3-in-a-Row-
This time with a GUI in Java

I guess my code is rubbish and there are many ways to implement that game in a more efficient way, but I still didnÂ´t learn java or how to use a GUI in the university, so this is pretty much my first project. Someday i will make another TIc Tac Toe Game when I have learned enough things.
